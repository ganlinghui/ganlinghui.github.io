About me
======



I'm a final year graduate student at the Department of Linguistics at [University of Connecticut](https://linguistics.uconn.edu/). I defended my Ph.D dissertation titled "Information Structure of the Clause-final Position in Hong Kong Sign Language" in May 2025.

I specialize in theoretical linguistic research in syntax and the syntax-semantics/prosody interfaces, with a focus on sign languages (asking the question "How is the mechanism of human language faculty reflected in sign languages?"). I am particularly interested in the *information structure of sign languages* and *bimodal bilingualism*, I also worked on a few sociolinguistic topics related to Deaf communities. My research has mainly focused on Hong Kong Sign Language (HKSL) and American Sign Language (ASL). 

I am a lab member of the UConn [Sign Linguistics & Language Acquisition Lab](https://slla.lab.uconn.edu/). I am currently involved in the Family ASL project (ASL-IPSyn and Vocabulary development by deaf children) and the CODA project (code-blending by adult CODAs). 


I used to work at the [Centre for Sign Linguistics and Deaf Studies](http://www.cslds.org/v4/) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I started my journey of doing sign language research. Before pursuing a Ph.D at UConn, I received my first master in *Chinese Linguistics and Language Acquisition* at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and my second research master in *Linguistics* at the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
