Thanks for visiting my website! 

Eva's personal website
======
I am currently a 7th year PhD student of Linguistics at [University of Connecticut](https://linguistics.uconn.edu/). I defended my dissertation titled "Information Structure of the Clause-final Position in Hong Kong Sign Language" in May 2025. My research interest is in the grammar of sign languages (asking the question "How is the mechanism of human language faculty reflected in sign languages?"). I am particularly interested in syntax-semantic/prosody interfaces of sign languages and bimodal bilingualism, I also worked on a few sociolinguistic topics related to Deaf communities. My research has mainly focused on Hong Kong Sign Language (HKSL) and American Sign Language (ASL). 

I am also a lab member of the UConn [Sign Linguistics & Language Acquisition Lab](https://slla.lab.uconn.edu/). I am currently involved in the Family ASL project (ASL-IPSyn and Vocabulary development) and the CODA project (code-blending). 

I used to work at the [Centre for Sign Linguistics and Deaf Studies](http://www.cslds.org/v4/) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I started my journey of doing sign language research. Before coming to Uconn, I received my first master's degree in Chinese Linguistics and Language Acquisition at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and my second research master's degree in Linguistics at the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
