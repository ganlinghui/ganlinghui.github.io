## Information Structure of sign languages
### My dissertation: Information Structure of the Clause-final Position in Hong Kong Sign Language 

How languages encode information structure notions (e.g., focus, topic) has been widely discussed across spoken languages, much less so in sign languages that adopt a visual-gestural modality. My dissertation investigates the information structure in sign languages by focusing on the correlation between focus and the clause-final position in Hong Kong Sign Language. The research question regarding the correlation emerges based on the observation that in many sign languages, but crucially, not so much across spoken languages, categories like wh-expressions in wh-questions, the A(nswer)-clause in clausal Question Answer Pairs (QAPs), negative markers, and focused phrases tend to occupy the clause-final position. This project aims to advance the scientific understanding of this phenomenon.
