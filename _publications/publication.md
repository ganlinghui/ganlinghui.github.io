## ü•ù Information structure of sign languages 
### My dissertation: *Information Structure of the Clause-final Position in Hong Kong Sign Language* 

My dissertation was motivated by the observation that across many unrelated sign languages, focus-related elements often appear in the clause-final position, including wh-questions, Question Answer Pairs, focused phrases (e.g., ONLY-phrases), and negatives. I investigated the syntactic, prosodic, and semantic properties of constructions that make use of the clause-final position, and how such usage is systematically related to information structure at the **right-periphery**. This project was awarded a Linguistics Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant by the [U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/ling-ddri-linguistics-program-doctoral-dissertation-research).
