## Information Structure of sign languages
### My dissertation: Information Structure of the Clause-final Position in Hong Kong Sign Language 

My dissertation was motivated by the observation that across many unrelated sign languages, focus-related elements often appear in the clause-final position, including wh-questions, Question Answer Pairs, focused phrases (e.g.ONLY-phrases), and negatives. I investigated the syntactic, prosodic, and semantic properties of constructions that make use of the clause-final position, and how such usage is systematically related to information structure at the right-periphery. This project was awarded a Linguistics Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF).
